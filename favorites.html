<h1>Motivation</h1>
I saw advice (from Marie Kondo, I think) about keeping no more than 30 books.

<h2>Quotes</h2>
My favorite quotes (in no particular order):

<ul>
	<li>
    <blockquote>
		  I shall mention a fact by which you may weigh the worth of a 
      man's character: you will scarcely find anyone who can live 
      with his door wide open.

    <blockquote>
      Yet all the knowledge on earth will give me nothing to 
      assure me that this world is mine. You describe it to me 
      and you teach me to classify it. You enumerate its laws and 
      in my thirst for knowledge I admit that they are true. You take
      apart its mechanism and my hope increases. At the final stage
      you teach me that this wondrous and multicolored universe can
      be reduced to the atom and that the atom itself can be reduced 
      to the electron. All this is good and I wait for you to continue.
      But you tell me of an invisible planetary system in which electrons
      gravitate around a nucleus. You explain this world to me with an image.
      I realize then that you have been reduced to poetry: I shall never know.
      Have I the time to become indignant? You have already changed theories.
      So that science that was to teach me everything ends up in a 
      hypothesis, that lucidity founders in metaphor, that uncertainty 
      is resolved in a work of art. What need had I of so many efforts?
    	The soft lines of these hills and the hand of evening on 
      this troubled heart teach me much more. I have returned to 
      my beginning. I realize that if through science I can seize 
      phenomena and enumerate them, I cannot, for all that, apprehend 
      the world. Were I to trace its entire relief with my finger, I 
      should not know any more.

    	If you throw some nuts and cookies on a road, you will 
      eventually see children come, pick them up, and start to 
      argue and fight for them. Adults would not fight for such 
      things. And even children would not pick up the nuts' empty 
      shells.
    	<p>
    	For a wise man, the wealth, the glory, and the rewards of this 
      world are like sweets or empty shells on a road. Let the children 
      pick them up and fight for them. Let them kiss the hands of the 
      rich men, the rulers, and their servants. For the wise one, all 
      these are but empty shells.

      "I still compete, Arnold," he said, clapping me on the
      shoulder, "only now it's against that." He pointed behind
      me, then tured and went back to his work-out. I turned and 
      looked. He had pointed at the clock.

      Out of every one hundred men, ten shouldn't even be there,

      one, one is a warrior, and he will bring the others back.

      When your sparring partner scratches or head=butts you, 
      you don't then take a show of it, or protest, or view him 
      with suspicion or as plotting aginst you. And yet you keep
      an eye on him, not as an enemy or with suspicion, but with a
      healthy avoidance. You should act this way with all things in 
      life. We should give a pass to many things with our fellow 
      trainees. For, as I've said, it's possible to avoid without
      suspicion or hate.

      I have just come to a realization! 
      This scroll by Broken Sword contains no secrets of 
      his swordsmanship. What this reveals is his highest 
      ideal. In the first state, man and sword become 
      one and each other. Here, even a blade of grass can 
      be used as a lethal weapon. In the next stage, the 
      sword resides not in the hand but in the heart. Even 
      without a weapon, the warrior can slay his enemy from a 
      hundred paces. But the ultimate ideal is when the sword 
      disappears altogether. The warrior embraces all around 
      him. The desire to kill no longer exists. Only peace remains.

<h1>Motivation</h1>
I saw advice (from Marie Kondo, I think) about keeping no more than 30 books.

      man's character: you will scarcely find anyone who can live 
      with his door wide open.

    <blockquote>
    	The soft lines of these hills and the hand of evening on 
      this troubled heart teach me much more. I have returned to 
      my beginning. I realize that if through science I can seize 
      phenomena and enumerate them, I cannot, for all that, apprehend 
      the world. Were I to trace its entire relief with my finger, I 
      should not know any more.

    <blockquote>
    	If you throw some nuts and cookies on a road, you will 
      eventually see children come, pick them up, and start to 
      argue and fight for them. Adults would not fight for such 
      things. And even children would not pick up the nuts' empty 
      shells.
    	<p>
    	For a wise man, the wealth, the glory, and the rewards of this 
      world are like sweets or empty shells on a road. Let the children 
      pick them up and fight for them. Let them kiss the hands of the 
      rich men, the rulers, and their servants. For the wise one, all 
      these are but empty shells.
